# Spells

Spells are composed of three things: effects, payloads, and casting shapes.

Effects
=======
Effects are what a spell does to an environment.

Payloads
========
Payloads apply spell effects to targets. They specify how things are targetted
and what effects will be applied to the targets.

Casting Shapes
==============
Casting shapes are what delivers payloads and activates them. They specify how
and what payloads are delivered.
